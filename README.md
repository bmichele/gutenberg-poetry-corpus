# A Gutenberg Poetry Corpus

By [Allison Parrish](https://www.decontextualize.com/)

This is a Gutenberg Poetry corpus, comprised of approximately three million
lines of poetry extracted from hundreds of books from [Project
Gutenberg](https://gutenberg.org/). The corpus is especially suited to
applications in creative computational poetic text generation.

[Download the corpus here.](http://static.decontextualize.com/gutenberg-poetry-v001.ndjson.gz)

## How to use it

The corpus is provided as a gzipped [newline-delimited JSON format](http://ndjson.org/).
Here's a representative excerpt:

    {"s": "The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,", "gid": "20"}
    {"s": "The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,", "gid": "20"}
    {"s": "While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.", "gid": "20"}
    {"s": "Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,", "gid": "20"}
    {"s": "Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in", "gid": "20"}

Each line of poetry is represented by a JSON object, with one object per line
in the archive. The value for the `s` key is the line of poetry itself, and the
value for the `gid` key is the ID of the Project Gutenberg book that the line
comes from. You can use the value for `gid` to look up the title and author of
the book that serves as that line's source, either "by hand" (just type the ID
into Project Gutenberg's search box) or using a computer-readable version of
the Project Gutenberg metadata (such as [Gutenberg,
dammit](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/)).

The [Quick Experiments notebook](quick-experiments.ipynb) included in this
repository shows how to get up and running quickly with the corpus in Python.
No need to install the Python module in this repository---working with the data is
surprisingly straightforward!

## How it was made

The corpus was generated using the included `build.py` script, which uses 
[Gutenberg, dammit](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/) to provide
access to books from Project Gutenberg. First, books with the string `poetry`
listed in their "Subject" metadata are added to a list. Then, the plaintext
versions of those books are scanned for lines that "look like" poetry, based on
a set of textual characteristics, such as their length and capitalization.
(See `build.py` for a list of these characteristics.) Finally, lines are
compared against a word list (from
[wordfilter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter)) to exclude lines that
may contain egregiously offensive content.

The corpus contains only lines of poetry from books that the Project Gutenberg
metadata identifies as being written in English and as being free from
copyright (i.e., public domain) in the United States.

## Examples of usage

Previous versions of this corpus have served as a foundation for several
projects produced by myself and others:

* [Gutenberg Poetry
  Autocomplete](http://gutenberg-poetry.decontextualize.com/), a search
  engine-like interface for writing poems mined from Project Gutenberg. (A poem
  written using this interface was [recently published in the Indianapolis
  Review](https://theindianapolisreview.com/betting-the-under/)!)
* [*Articulations*](http://counterpathpress.org/articulations-allison-parrish),
  a book of poetry created by finding phonetically similar lines of poetry in
  Project Gutenberg
* [Plot to Poem](http://static.decontextualize.com/plot-to-poem.html), a quick
  [NaPoGenMo](https://github.com/NaPoGenMo/) project that finds the lines of
  poetry closest in meaning to sentences from Wikipedia plot summaries
* [Lynn Cherny](http://www.ghostweather.com/) used a version of this corpus to
  do [some quick and dirty computational stylistics on computer-generated
  poetry](https://medium.com/@lynn_72328/cocos-memory-palace-a-strange-fantasia-28b48264612f).

If you make something cool with this corpus, let me know!

## Build your own from scratch

You don't need to read any of the following if you just want to use the corpus.
If you're interested in building your own version from scratch, read on.

This repository includes a script to build the Gutenberg Poetry corpus from the
files included in [Gutenberg,
dammit](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/). First, download the
*Gutenberg, dammit* archive. Then install [Gutenberg,
dammit](https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/) and this package, like so:

```bash
pip install https://github.com/aparrish/gutenberg-dammit/archive/master.zip
pip install https://github.com/bmichele/gutenberg-poetry-corpus/archive/master.zip
```

You can then run the following command to produce your own version of the
corpus:

```bash
python -m gutenbergpoetrycorpus.build --srczip=PATH-TO-GUTENBERG-DAMMIT-ZIP | gzip -c >gutenberg-poetry.ndjson.gz
```

Parameters for what gets included in the corpus can be adjusted in `build.py`.
(E.g., it should be relatively easy to adapt this script to produce corpora of
poetry in different languages!)

## License

To the best of my knowledge, the Gutenberg Poetry corpus contains only text

States). For avoidance of doubt, I release the particular arrangement of these
